# pesto_check
We all know that [pesto](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/BasilPesto.JPG/1920px-BasilPesto.JPG) is the greatest and most heavenly of all sauces... but where to get it? This program offers a solution [for residents of the UC Berkeley area], by scraping the websites of nearby restaurants known to occasionally offer dishes containing pesto. Currently-searched businesses include the UCB dining commons, Cheese Board, and Sliver Pizzeria.

To run, simply download all of the files and execute either `./run_pesto_check` or `python3 search.py` through the command line. Note that the only platform that pesto_check currently supports is OS X, because that is the only platform to which the lead (and only) developer has current access.

Also, the Python bindings for Selenium must be installed on your computer. If they are not, then you can install them easily with the command `pip install selenium`, or by visiting the Selenium [download page](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).

We hope you enjoy the pesto (assuming it's even possible _not_ to, that is)!
